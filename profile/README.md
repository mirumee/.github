# Welcome to Mirumee Commerce Lab

We specialize in **global e-commerce transformation** and **product development.** As a **Commerce Lab**, we explore, prototype, and share new ways of thinking about digital retail.

**Open source** is at the core of our philosophy. Weâ€™re the creators of well-known solutions like **Saleor**, **Nimara**, **Ariadne** and other open-source tools powering the future of digital commerce.

We love **Python**, **GraphQL**, **TypeScript**, modern frontend frameworks, and doing things the right way.

## ðŸ’› Our Values:

**Sustainable Open Source** - We build with the long term in mind. Our tools are actively maintained, used in production by global brands, and designed for teams that need reliability, not experiments.

**Built to Scale** - Whether you're scaling to millions of users or orchestrating complex architectures, we care about performance, extensibility, and operational visibility from day one.

**Developer-Centric Design** - We believe great developer experience is a business advantage. Our solutions are easy to integrate, well documented, and built for teams that value velocity and clarity.

**Composable by Default** - We champion flexible, API-first architecture. Every tool we create supports modular thinking, future-proof design, and freedom from platform lock-in.

**Collaboration Over Handoff** - We don't just ship and disappear. Our best work happens in long-term partnerships where strategy, design, and engineering move forward together.
